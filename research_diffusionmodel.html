<!--Common molecular biology techniques such as DNA assembly, plasmid extraction and bacterial transformation involve labor-intensive
                        manual processes and are currently difficult to scale. These processes become tedious and more error-prone when handling many samples
                        at once. To address these notable challenges and accelerate discoveries in plant synthetic biology and related disciplines, we are deploying
                        Opentrons OT-2 liquid-handling robots to automate these procedures. The Designer Glycans lab is developing Python protocols to adapt
                        various experimental steps for the OT-2 system. Specifically, I designed a small volume transfer protocol for DNA manipulations and
                        amplifications allowing biologists to customize sample volumes, positions, and pipetting parameters in a user-friendly table, catering to
                        diverse scientific needs. Moreover, the OT-2 robots can also facilitate more intricate processes like plasmid extraction using 96-well
                        plates and modular equipment such as programmable magnetic blocks. Overall, our implementation of liquid handling robots into otherwise
                        artisanal procedures will reduce scientific barriers and minimize errors for biological research and product development.-->
