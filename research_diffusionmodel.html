                        Currently, I am a part of the AI Scholars program at the University of Florida, where I am working under Dr. Catalin Voiniciuc
                        at the <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.designerglycans.com/">Designer Glycans</a> Lab, as well as Dr. Wenjun Xie. 
                        My project is "Synthetic Biology Meets Generative AI: Extending Diffusion Models to DNA Sequences for Programmable CSLA Enzyme 
                        Generation". I am researching how to computationally generate CSLA enzymes with programmable activities, using our lab's collected 
                        data of the structures and functions of such enzymes.

                        Thus far while beginning the project, I have begun working with Dr. Wenjun Xie's maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model, which uses .a3m 
                        multiple sequence aligned (MSA) files as input in order to train. This model is then used to calculate the mutational energies for 
                        mutations in CSLA enzyme sequences. These mutational energies, once ranked, show how favorable a mutation is for an enzyme. Dr. Wenjun
                        Xie has suggested during this time that in truth the diffusion model is not optimal for enzyme mutation sequence generation, and has
                        instead directed me toward Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
