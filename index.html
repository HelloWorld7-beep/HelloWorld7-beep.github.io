                I am currently a junior undergraduate student at the University of Florida majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics.

                In the future, my plan is to get a Ph.D in computer science, and then work either as an academic or in industry. The reason that
                I want to continue my education rather than starting a job right out of undergrad is because I enjoy research, and I want to make discoveries
                that are beneficial to society. I enjoy the experience of learning new things and applying my current skills to solve problems that no one
                else has considered before.

    Currently, I am a part of the AI Scholars program at the University of Florida, where I am working under Professor Voiniciuc
                at the <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.designerglycans.com/">Designer Glycans</a> Lab. My project is <span>"Synthetic Biology
                Meets Generative AI: Extending Diffusion Models to DNA Sequences for Programmable CSLA Enzyme Generation"</span>. I am researching
                how to computationally generate CSLA enzymes with programmable activities, using our lab's collected data of the structures and
                functions of such enzymes.
