                I am currently a junior undergraduate student at the University of Florida majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics.
            </p>

                Future
            </h2>
            <p class="about-paragraphs">
                My plan is to get a Ph.D in computer science, and then work either as an academic or in industry R&D. The reason that
                I want to continue my education rather than starting a job right out of undergrad is because I enjoy research, and I want to make discoveries
                that are beneficial to society. I enjoy the experience of learning new things and applying my current skills to solve problems that no one
                else has considered before.
