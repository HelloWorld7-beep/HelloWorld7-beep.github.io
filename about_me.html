                        <p class="about-paragraphs">
                            I am currently a third year undergraduate student at the University of Florida majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="sub-subtitle">Future</h2>
                        <p class="about-paragraphs">
                            My plan is to get a Ph.D in computer science, and then work either as an academic or in industry R&D. The reason that
                            I want to continue my education rather than starting a job right out of undergrad is because I enjoy research, and I want to make discoveries
                            that are beneficial to society. I enjoy the experience of learning new things and applying my current skills to solve problems that no one
                            else has considered before.

                <h2 class="sub-subtitle">Some of my favorite quotes:</h2>
                <p class="fav-quotes">
                    “Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never
                    be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.” <span class="name-italic">- John Green</span>
                </p>
                <p class="fav-quotes">
                    “Science fiction is the literature of dreams, and texts concerning dreams always say something about the dreamer, the dream interpreter, and
                    the audience.” <span class="name-italic">- Ken Liu</span>
                </p>
                <p class="fav-quotes">
                    “I’ve managed to stay in a perpetual state of learning only by maintaining what I think of as a posture of ignorant humility. This humility
                    is as mandatory as arrogance… There is only one way to deal with this humiliation: bow you head, let go of the idea that you know anything,
                    and ask politely of this new machine “How do you wish to be operated?” If you accept your ignorance, once you really admit to yourself that
                    everything you know is now useless, the new machine will be good to you and tell you: here is how to operate me.”
