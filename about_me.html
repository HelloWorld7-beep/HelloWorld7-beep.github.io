                        I am currently a third year undergraduate student at the University of Florida majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics.

                        My plan is to get a Ph.D in computer science, and then work either as an academic or in industry R&D. The reason that
                        I want to continue my education rather than starting a job right out of undergrad is because I enjoy research, and I want to make discoveries
                        that are beneficial to society. I enjoy the experience of learning new things and applying my current skills to solve problems that no one
                        else has considered before.
