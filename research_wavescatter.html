                        This research project aimed to create a more efficient solver for the forward scattering problem, for objects with a
                        thin coating. This involves figuring out the scattered waves created when a wave hits an impenetrable obstacle that's 
                        covered by a thin, penetrable layer. This has many practical applications, such as designing coatings that can hide 
                        objects from radar in the defense industry or creating special thin films for lenses to change their properties.

                        In the beginning, I read through many papers in order to familiarize myself with the topic of research. I then presented my knowledge
                        to my PI, Dr. Carlos Borges, along with my partner in the REU. During this time we also attended various workshops and seminars relating 
                        to computational mathematics. 
                        <br /><br />
                        Finally, we began work on the project itself, and in order to create the solver we modified Matlab code that was meant to
                        solve the forward problem for impenetrable objects without a thin layer. In order to make the solver less costly computationally, we 
                        simplified the original forward problem for an object with a thin coating, called the transmission problem, using General Impedance
                        Boundary Conditions (GIBCs). These GIBCs simplified the wave equation which calculated the wave as it travelled through the thin layer,
                        instead turning this complex equation into simpler boundary conditions. These GIBCs were then used in the code to replace the original
                        Dirichlet boundary condition. This approximation was called the impedance problem, and we compared its results to the "true solution", aka
                        the transmission problem. We used order 1 and order 2 GIBCs, since the higher the order of GIBC the more complex the condition was.
                        The GIBCs calculated ranged from orders 0-4, however 0 was too simple and 3-4 too complex for the approximation. 
                        <br /><br />
                        In our final results, we found that GIBC order 2 was a nearly perfect approximation. Then after getting these results, we presented our project 
                        in a poster symposium at UCF.

<!--Common molecular biology techniques such as DNA assembly, plasmid extraction and bacterial transformation involve labor-intensive
                        manual processes and are currently difficult to scale. These processes become tedious and more error-prone when handling many samples
                        at once. To address these notable challenges and accelerate discoveries in plant synthetic biology and related disciplines, we are deploying
                        Opentrons OT-2 liquid-handling robots to automate these procedures. The Designer Glycans lab is developing Python protocols to adapt
                        various experimental steps for the OT-2 system. Specifically, I designed a small volume transfer protocol for DNA manipulations and
                        amplifications allowing biologists to customize sample volumes, positions, and pipetting parameters in a user-friendly table, catering to
                        diverse scientific needs. Moreover, the OT-2 robots can also facilitate more intricate processes like plasmid extraction using 96-well
                        plates and modular equipment such as programmable magnetic blocks. Overall, our implementation of liquid handling robots into otherwise
                        artisanal procedures will reduce scientific barriers and minimize errors for biological research and product development.-->
