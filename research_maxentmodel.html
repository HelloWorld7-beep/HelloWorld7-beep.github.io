                        Currently, I am a part of the AI Scholars program at the University of Florida, where I am working under Dr. Catalin Voiniciuc
                        at the <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.designerglycans.com/">Designer Glycans</a> Lab, as well as Dr. Wenjun Xie. 
                        My project is "Using the Maximum Entropy Model to Enhance CSLA Enzyme β-Mannan Polysaccharide Synthesis". I am researching how to computationally generate CSLA enzymes that produce plant β-mannan polysaccharides, with 
                        programmable activities, using our lab's collected data of the structures and functions of such enzymes.
                        <br />
                        Mannans are a type of polysaccharide found in hemicellulose, which are critical to food, material, energy, and biomedical 
                        industries. They are present in plant cell walls and are a major source of biomass. Structural variations, from β-mannans 
                        in palm seeds to galactomannans in legumes, allow them to function as thickeners, stabilizers, and dietary fibers in food, 
                        as well as renewable resources for biofuels and bioplastics.

                        I have used Dr. Wenjun Xie's maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model, which uses .a3m multiple sequence aligned (MSA) files as input 
                        in order to train. This model is then used to calculate the mutational energies for mutations in CSLA enzyme sequences. 
                        These mutational energies, once ranked, show how favorable a mutation is for an enzyme.
