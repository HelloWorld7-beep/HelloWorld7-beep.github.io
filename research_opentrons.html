                            This research project focused on enhancing the speed and accuracy of molecular biology experiments through the use of 
                            liquid-pipetting robots, specifically the Opentrons OT-2. These advanced robots can manage numerous liquid samples simultaneously 
                            with exceptional precision, offering a significant advantage for scientists conducting extensive sample testing. By developing
                            Python protocols for the two robots in our lab, I managed to simplify and scale up essential tasks such as DNA assembly and 
                            plasmid extraction. This not only saves time and effort but also helps scientists find new discoveries more quickly and with fewer 
                            human errors.

                    <p class="res-paragraphs">
                        I am working with Dr. Catalin Voiniciuc at the <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.designerglycans.com/">Designer Glycans</a> Lab
                        and with his postdoc Moni Qiande. 
                        In this project, my responsibilities centered around programming the necessary Python protocols for my principal investigator (PI) 
                        Dr. Catalin Voiniciuc and fellow lab members, aiming to streamline and scale up various laboratory procedures. I developed specific 
                        protocols for procedures such as DNA assembly and plasmid extraction, as well as modifiable code for general liquid transfers. 
                        This customizable code allowed users to control processes like mixing, transferring, and picking up tips according to their needs. I 
                        worked closely with Moni Quiande to test and optimize the protocols. Additionally, I organized and optimized the operational procedures 
                        and layout for the OT-2 robots, ensuring efficient and effective use in the lab.
                        <br /><br />
                        Currently, I am continuing to work on some protocols for the OT-2, such as for scaling a plasmid extraction protocol.

<!--Common molecular biology techniques such as DNA assembly, plasmid extraction and bacterial transformation involve labor-intensive
                        manual processes and are currently difficult to scale. These processes become tedious and more error-prone when handling many samples
                        at once. To address these notable challenges and accelerate discoveries in plant synthetic biology and related disciplines, we are deploying
                        Opentrons OT-2 liquid-handling robots to automate these procedures. The Designer Glycans lab is developing Python protocols to adapt
                        various experimental steps for the OT-2 system. Specifically, I designed a small volume transfer protocol for DNA manipulations and
                        amplifications allowing biologists to customize sample volumes, positions, and pipetting parameters in a user-friendly table, catering to
                        diverse scientific needs. Moreover, the OT-2 robots can also facilitate more intricate processes like plasmid extraction using 96-well
                        plates and modular equipment such as programmable magnetic blocks. Overall, our implementation of liquid handling robots into otherwise
                        artisanal procedures will reduce scientific barriers and minimize errors for biological research and product development.-->
