                        This research project aimed to make molecular biology experiments faster and more accurate by using robots
                        to do the work that scientists usually have to do by hand. These robots, called Opentrons OT-2, can handle many liquid
                        samples at once with extreme accuracy, which is very helpful for scientists who need to test a lot of samples.
                        By programming Python protocols for these robots, I simplified and scaled up tasks like DNA assemly and plasmid extraction.
                        This not only saves time and effort but also helps scientists find new discoveries more quickly and with fewer errors.

<!--Common molecular biology techniques such as DNA assembly, plasmid extraction and bacterial transformation involve labor-intensive
                        manual processes and are currently difficult to scale. These processes become tedious and more error-prone when handling many samples
                        at once. To address these notable challenges and accelerate discoveries in plant synthetic biology and related disciplines, we are deploying
                        Opentrons OT-2 liquid-handling robots to automate these procedures. The Designer Glycans lab is developing Python protocols to adapt
                        various experimental steps for the OT-2 system. Specifically, I designed a small volume transfer protocol for DNA manipulations and
                        amplifications allowing biologists to customize sample volumes, positions, and pipetting parameters in a user-friendly table, catering to
                        diverse scientific needs. Moreover, the OT-2 robots can also facilitate more intricate processes like plasmid extraction using 96-well
                        plates and modular equipment such as programmable magnetic blocks. Overall, our implementation of liquid handling robots into otherwise
                        artisanal procedures will reduce scientific barriers and minimize errors for biological research and product development.-->
